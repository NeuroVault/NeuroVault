            <h3>How to cite NeuroVault in papers.</h3>
            <p>If you uploaded maps to NeuroVault and want to reference them in
                your paper please include the Compact Identifier (<code>https://identifiers.org/neurovault.collection:...</code>;
                see collection landing page for details) of your collection.
                In case your paper is under review and you wish to keep your
                collection private use the collections private URL and replace
                it with the Compact Identifier during the proofreading stage.
                Don't forget to make your collection public and update its
                metadata with the DOI of the related publication after the
                paper gets published.<br>
