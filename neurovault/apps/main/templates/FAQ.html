            <h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
            <h4>1. What is this website for?</h4>
                <p> The purpose of this website/database is to collect and
                    distribute
                    statistical maps of the brain. Such maps are acquired by
                    scientists
                    all around the world using brain imaging techniques such as
                    MRI or
                    PET in a combined effort to map the functions and
                    structures of the
                    brain. Unfortunately, due to the limitations of the
                    academic paper
                    form (as in publication not pulp) in which most findings
                    are
                    disseminated, only coordinates of peaks are reported. This
                    makes
                    doing meta-analyses and hypothesis-driven studies very
                    difficult.
                    With <b>unthresholded</b> statistical maps, one can find
                    subthreshold effects that are consistent across studies,
                    which
                    cannot be achieved using just peak coordinates. You can
                    read more
                    about NeuroVault in our
                    <a href="http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fninf.2015.00008/full">paper</a>.
                </p>
            <h4>2. Why would I submit anything?</h4>
                <p> When you submit data to NeuroVault you will be provided
                    with a
                    permanent link for each map. The links lead to an
                    interactive
                    visualization. You can share you results with other
                    researchers
                    without sending files around! Readers of your papers will
                    also
                    appreciate additional clarity provided by an interactive
                    visualization. Therefore you can include links to your
                    NeuroVault
                    dataset in your paper (see
                    <a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/content/33/42/16657.short">this</a>
                    and
                    <a href="http://www.frontiersin.org/Journal/10.3389/fnhum.2013.00734/abstract">this
                        paper</a>).
                    On top of that, all the maps uploaded to NeuroVault can be
                    decoded
                    using <a href="http://neurosynth.org">neurosynth.org</a>.
                </p>
            <h4 id="persistance">3. How do I know my data is safe and will be
                available
                for the years to come?</h4>
                <p> All of NeuroVault is backed up daily into off site storage.
                    In
                    addition all of the public collections that have been
                    associated
                    with
                    a paper (through the DOI field) will be archived in
                    <a href="https://purl.stanford.edu/qd938sk1220">Stanford
                        Digital
                        Repository (SDR)</a>. This operation is performed in
                    bulk twice
                    a year and ensures long term preservation of maps deposited
                    in
                    NeuroVault.
                </p>
            <h4 id="decoding">4. How does decoding work?</h4>
                <p> Decoding is an experimental feature that takes your map and
                    compares
                    it with patterns associated with cognitive terms in
                    thousands of
                    papers. All the hard work is provided by
                    <a href="http://neurosynth.org">neurosynth.org</a>, which
                    will pull
                    your map from NeuroVault and run spatial correlation
                    restricted by
                    a
                    gray matter mask. Give it a try - just hit the "Decode"
                    button
                    above
                    any image. This can potentially be very useful in
                    interpreting your
                    results. The feature is still experimental and we would be
                    grateful
                    for any feedback.

            <h4> 6. Is it only about fMRI?</h4>
                <p> No - not at all. We accept any brain data that is stored in
                    a 3D
                    NIFTI format and has been <b>transformed into MNI space</b>.
                    This
                    means that structural studies (for example VBM) as well as
                    PET are
                    more than welcomed here.</p>
            <h4> 7. How can I access the database in a programmatic way? Is
                there an
                API?</h4>
                <p>
                    Yes there is a RESTful API - you can find it
                    <a href="{% url 'api-docs' %}">here</a>. There are also <a
                        href="https://github.com/NeuroVault/pyneurovault">python</a>

                <p> NeuroVault is being built by a group of dedicated
                    developers led by
                    Chris Gorgolewski. They include (in no particular order):

                share whole
                datasets!</h4>
                <p> NeuroVault is dedicated to just statistical maps, but you
                    should
                    check out <a href="http://www.openfmri.org">OpenfMRI</a>.
                    Additionally you might consider publishing a <a

            <h4> 12. Those are some beautiful viewers! Where did you get them
                from?</h4>
                <p> We use <a

                <p> All data in NeuroVault (with exclusion of private
                    collections) is

                viewer.</h4>
                <p> Use this command line FSL tool: <code>fslcpgeom MNIatlas

            <h4> 15. Should I add a NeuroVault link to the paper I'm about to
                submit?
                What's the best practice of doing this?</h4>
                <p> Linking unthresholded maps is a great way to allow the
                    readers of
                    your paper to explore your results and reuse them in their
                    work. We
                    recommend grouping all maps from one study/paper in a
                    single
                    collection and including a link to that collection in your
                    manuscript. Additionally one can include links to
                    individual maps
                    in figure captions. An example can be found in <a
                            href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2017.10.059">the
                        following publication, the caption of Fig. 3</a>.
                    Please note
                    that if you decide to use a private collection (e.g.,
                    during
                    peer-review), a unique string is added to the URL so people
                    would
                    not be able to guess the address. Additionally, it's worth
                    mentioning that if your collection was initially private
                    (so it got
                    longer URLs) and you later made it public, both URLs
                    (public and
                    private) will resolve correctly. This allows users to keep
                    collections private during peer-review and make them public
                    after
                    the paper gets published (which is not required but can be
                    preferred by some).</p>
