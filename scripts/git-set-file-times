# clients and content delivery networks can get consistent
# Last-Modified headers no matter which HTTP server in the
# cluster they hit.  This should improve caching behavior.

# This does not take into account merges, but if you're updating
# every machine in the cluster from the same commit (A) to the
# same commit (B), the mtimes will be _consistent_ across all
# machines if not necessarily accurate.

# THIS IS NOT INTENDED TO OPTIMIZE BUILD SYSTEMS SUCH AS 'make'
